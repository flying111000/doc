VS2015 Dark Theme for Notepad++

Atom Version
Android Studio / IntelliJ Version
This is as close as I can get to a replica of the Visual Studio 2015's Dark theme in Notepad++. I created it to ease switching between files opened in Visual Studio and Notepad++. Particularly close attention has been paid to C, C++, and XML but a number of other languages have been tested.

Installation

Right Click HERE and select Save As to download the theme.
Go to %APPDATA%\Notepad++.
Open themes folder, create a new folder named themes if it doesn't exists.
Place downloaded .xml file inside the folder.
Restart Notepad++.
Open Settings->Style Configurator.
Select VS2015-Dark from the theme drop-down box.
Click Save & Close
