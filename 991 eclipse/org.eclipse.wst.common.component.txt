Eclipse uses the data in org.eclipse.wst.common.component to figure out the dependencies needed for deployment. The file corresponds to the settings found in Eclipse when Right-clicking on an EAR project > Properties > Deployment Assembly.

E.g. if your EAR project has a dependency on a WAR project then Eclipse knows to include the WAR when deploying because of the Deployment Assembly settings which get stored in org.eclipse.wst.common.component

When building the EAR using Ant you need to add these dependencies manually (without relying on Eclipse metadata)
