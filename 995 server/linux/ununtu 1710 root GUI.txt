This link(https://economictheoryblog.com/2015/11/08/how-to-enable-gui-root-login-in-debian-8/) points it out for Debian, but instead of daemon.conf just edit custom.conf. Everything else is the same.

In a nutshell, first run

sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
Under [security] type AllowRoot=true so that it looks like

[security]
AllowRoot=true
Save and exit. Then run

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password
Within this file you have comment out the line containing

auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success
so that it looks like this

#auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success
Save the file and exit and reboot.
