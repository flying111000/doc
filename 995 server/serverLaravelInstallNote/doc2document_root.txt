Please note, that this only applies for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and newer releases.

In my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the document root was set to /var/www/html. It was configured in the following file:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
So just do a

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
and change the following line to what you want:

DocumentRoot /var/www/html
Also do a

sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
and find this

<Directory /var/www/html/>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Require all granted
</Directory>
and change /var/www/html to your preferred directory

and save it.

After you saved your changes, just restart the apache2 webserver and you'll be done :)


sudo service apache2 restart
