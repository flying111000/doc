The following worked for me:

1.run VBoxManage internalcommands sethduuid "VDI/VMDK file" twice (the first time is just to conveniently generate an UUID, you could use any other UUID generation method instead)
2.open the .vbox file in a text editor
3.replace the UUID found in Machine uuid="{...}" with the UUID you got when you ran sethduuid the first time
4.replace the UUID found in HardDisk uuid="{...}" and in Image uuid="{}" (towards the end) with the UUID you got when you ran sethduuid the second time

"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage" internalcommands sethduuid "C:\Users\Geoffrey.Chen\VirtualBox VMs\ubuntu006\ubuntu006.vdi"
